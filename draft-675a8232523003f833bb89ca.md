Last week, I experimented a lot with the dummy pass provided by Chris. Also, I spent majority of the time just reading through the GCC documentation, which at first was very confusing but as I kept reading it, it become easier to understand.

So I experimented with the pass that Chris provided, my thought process was we think about the problem by isolating it completely from the GCC compiler. Let’s just say we have to design a simple function which goes through a piece of text or file and flags all the redundant paragraphs, because that is what we are trying to achieve, when we think about it in this way then It looks a lot easier to attain. Now instead of checking texts, we are going to be checking the binaries of all the function clones and flagging them if they needed to be pruned.

Now let’s have a look at the pass that I made for stage-2:

So let’s start by discussing the function `compare_gimple_functions` which compares two GIMPLE statement sequences with a simple `while loop`, it iterates through the sequences by using an iterator, remember the simplified problem that I was talking about above, this is the logic that I would have used to compare two files.

Now talking about the `execute` function, the heart of this pass, so inside the binaries if the function has different clones, it Is usually represented by the same function name, with an “\_1“ or “\_2“ after the function name, which means it is a clone that is made to improve efficiency, the pass’s job is to compare this clone with its base function and if it is still the same as the base function then flag it for pruning.

Starting with the initial if block, it checks if the compiler analyses the function, if not it prints a diagnostic message and moves to the next iteration. The `node->analyzed` check is necessary and adds value as a safeguard.

Start with the `FOR_EACH_FUNCTION` loop my aim is to first check if a function name has an “\_1” like value at the end of its name, if yes then it is a clone of the base function, then we go ahead to compare the base function and this function using our `ompare_gimple_functions` method which checks if both the functions are the same or not. If it is the same it prints the function name with a `PRUNE:` prefix and if it is not the same it prints the function name with a `NOPRUNE:` prefix.

I managed to write this logic, comparing it to our initial simplified problem analogy, but this code has it’s problems, I managed to write a pseudocode kinda logic of what I wanted to do in this pass, but it turns it has 3 main errors.

Firstly, because I am incorrectly using the functions and macros of Gimple. In order to solve the issue, I dedicated a lot of time to going through the documentation of GCC(GIMPLE). Now I have a better understanding of what basically goes on with a gimple pass and a mild idea of what to use, but I currently don’t have the time to come up with a new code for the pass.

That’s why my main advice to the future students joining this course would be to first of all, be very comfortable with configuring, building and installing the GCC compiler. Not only that but read through as much documentation as possible, specifically on GIMPLE as that’s the type of pass we are going to design for our project
